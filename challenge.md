# ModeStreet front-end challenge

Challenge is to build a product listing page.

## Rules

- The product listing page can't be static.
- All details should be shown from `products.json`.

## Requirements

- For each product we have multiple size and sources, you have to show following information:
    - Image
    - Name
    - Available Sizes
    - Available Sources
    - Price depends on size and source
- It must be possible to show minimum price.
- It must be possible to add pagination/lazy loading.
- It must be possible to add products by size and source to the cart.
- It must be possible to view the cart with the items you've added (name, image, price, size, source, quantity) and the grand total.
- The cart should be persisted between reloads.

## Bonus points

- Easy as pie? So add more functionality to cart allowing users to add, remove and change quantity of cart items.
- Want more challenges? Add a filters(Brand, In stock, Color, Size etc) or a search box.
- We like clean and testable code, right? Test your application and components, it will be a big bonus point.

## What we will evaluate

- The `git` history will be avaluated.
- Our stack here is React, Redux, SCSS and Webpack so using the same stack will make a difference.
- We're looking for a front-end developer who knows how to build layouts and knows a lot about JavaScript. Use this as an opportunity to show us how good you are on both areas.
- Do not forget to document the process needed to run and build your app. Or else how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?

## Got questions?

- The challenge is harder than you anticipated? Would you like to show your experience with something else? Contact us by opening an _issue_.
